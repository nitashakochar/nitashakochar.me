          <h2>My Project: Increase Sales for the New York's Best Page</h2>
          <p>
            NY's Best refers to the best of locally produced food and beverages. On average, shopping carts containing NY's Best items are worth more. Despite weekly additions of new products to the NY's Best page, however, sales continued to
            remain
            stagnant. As the
            only intern in the New York office, I was tasked with investigating the lack of growth in sales from the NY’s Best page compared to the annual revenue growth for the Chicago’s Best page.

          <h3>Survey Design</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span>When my manager first asked me to go to the NY's Best page on the website, I could not find it.</span> <br /><br />My instinct was to browse through the navigation tabs, dissect the homepage for anything that said "New York" on
          it...I even typed
          "NY's Best" into the search bar, and I got nothing. Wow, I thought to myself, how can I not find the single most important page for my project? A few moments went by and then I asked my manager for help. She scrolled through the
          homepage and then clicked on a tile with an image of assorted bagels on it. Below the tile in tiny text I see the words "NY's Best".
        </p>

        <p>
          I attributed my inability to find the NY's Best page to a failure in design. As a potential new user on the platform, it would make sense if I did not know that the NY's Best page existed- I could say the problem here was poor
          digital marketing. But if Peapod's goal is to sell more products from the NY's Best page, then then targeting new users will prove difficult. I was told as a new user to purchase an item from the NY's Best page but had
          trouble finding that page. Indeed, I was frustrated and gave up after a few moments. <br /><br /><span>As a new user, I would probably never look for the NY's Best page ever again.</span>
        </p>

        <p>I was instantly curious to know how easy it was to locate the NY's Bestpage as a new or returning user. To answer this question, I created a survey that asked users about their experience on the platform and then tasked
          users with
          timing themselves as they tried to find the NY's Best page. I reached out to both returning platform users, as well as potential new users, between the ages of 18-65. </p>

          Another aspect of the survey was to collect general user feedback. In the end, there were quite a few <span>pain-points</span> for the survey respondents on both the home and NYB pages:

        <div class="survey-results">
          <p>
            By creating an online survey and analyzing the 25+ responses, I concluded that <span>75% of returning users were unaware of the NY’s Best page, and 28% of overall respondents were ultimately unable to locate the page.</span> This led
            me
            to both alter
            my
            original approach and work closely with the digital marketing team to promote local products on the homepage and develop a targeted marketing cadence featuring new local products.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>
          The feedback I received in this survey demonstrated immense opportunity for improving the user experience and marketing strategy for the NY's Best page.
          I divided my approach into three categories:
        </h3>

        <div class="flex" id="three-things">
          <div class="flex col width33 border">
            <h4><span>1. Awareness Off the Site </span><br />
              <i> <small> Vendor co-marketing & Peapod marketing </small></i>
            </h4>
            <p>
              Awareness off the site includes having local vendors promote peapod somewhere on their website if they don't already. Another approach I've thought about is to send direct mail cards to GIJ customers who have opted out of emails.
              Though
              this
              category in particular is not a main priority currently.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="flex col width33 border">
            <h4><span>2. Awareness On the Site </span><br />
              <i> <small>Promote on homepage, splash pages, etc.</small></i>
            </h4>
            <p>
              By “Awareness on the site” I mean how do people get to the NYB page? My top priority is from the homepage. NYB is not clearly highlighted on there and having to scroll down ANY page means information gets lost. We’d also like
              customers
              to
              get to the NYB page through various splash pages, key words, and item-details.
              I also wanted to figure out how to drive the NYB page at item level. Perhaps having flags on the top left corner of each item with a clear "NYB" or "Local" label could accomplish that.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="flex col width33 border">
            <h4><span>3. Page Design & Layout</span> <br />
              <i> <small> Simplify, clarify, inspire, and assist</small></i>
            </h4>
            <p>
              And for my last tactic, the NY's best page can definitely do with a redesign. To improve engagement on the NYB page, I think we need to explicitly define for the customer what makes a product “New York’s Best” and establish that
              definition
              versus ”local”. The inherent goal of my strategy is to display NYB products throughout the entire peapod shopping experience, creating various access points to the NYB page.
